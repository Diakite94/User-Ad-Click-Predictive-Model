# User-Ad-Click-Predictive-Model
Used Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Sklearn to analyze an artificial Advertising data and create a Logistic Regression Model to predict whether a user will click on an Ad based off the features or interests of that user.

The data and exercise template were provided by an instructor at The Knowledge House (Tech Bootcamp). For easy access, I have added the data (which I do not own) to my Qri data profile: https://qri.cloud/ldiakite/advertising_data
